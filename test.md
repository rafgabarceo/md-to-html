# About me

Hi! I am Rafael Gabriel Arceo. I am currently a software engineer under the **Phitopolis**
graduate program.

## Experience
Previously, I was the web editor of The LaSallian, the official student publication of De La Salle University.
I was both a social media manager and a web developer. I provisioned and approved captions for the organization's social media pages and also
I maintained and developed the organization's main website, along with other small websites known as "specials" to present theme-based content.
