# About me

Hi! I am Rafael Gabriel Arceo. I am currently a software engineer under the **Phitopolis**
graduate program.

## Experience
Previously, I was the web editor of The LaSallian, the official student publication of De La Salle University.
I was both a social media manager and a web developer. I provisioned and approved captions for the organization's social media pages and also
I maintained and developed the organization's main website, along with other small websites known as "specials" to present theme-based content.

There are the things that I like about being a developer:
1. Create software 
2. Use Neovim
3. See the pretty colors on my screen

This is an example of an unordered list!
- Chocolate
- Milk
- tastes
- Good
