<h1> About me</h1><p>Hi! I am Rafael Gabriel Arceo. I am currently a software engineer under the <b>Phitopolis</b>&nbsp;graduate program.&nbsp;</p><h2> Experience</h2>Previously, I was the web editor of The LaSallian, the official student publication of De La Salle University.&nbsp;I was both a social media manager and a web developer. I provisioned and approved captions for the organization's social media pages and also&nbsp;I maintained and developed the organization's main website, along with other small websites known as "specials" to present theme-based content.&nbsp;<p>
